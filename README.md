### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a PhD Candidate and Satre Family Fellow at Stanford University [webpage](https://kdmayer.github.io/).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on reconstructing 3D building models from airborne LiDAR and floor plan images at scale.
- âš¡ At the moment, I am mostly working with diffusion-based generative machine learning algorithms for 3D graphs.
